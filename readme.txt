A beautiful set of sliders for WooCommerce products and categories

== Description ==

Create amazing content with one of our 8 totally different WooCommerce slider styles. You can easily place featured products in a cool responsive slider and let your visitors fully experience what you have to offer. 

Sliders generate a shortcode which means that they can be placed anywhere on your website and they will fit right into the content. We have also created a Visual Composer shortcode, so if you have both Visual Composer and WooShop Slider you can easily add new sliders to your content.
